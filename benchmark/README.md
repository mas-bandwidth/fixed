# Numerical performance checks

`numerical_bench.c` measures affected public operations with runtime-generated,
repeatable inputs. Setup is outside the timed loops; each operation warms up,
consumes every output component, and emits a checksum. The multiply row is an
unchanged control. The optional third argument selects one operation for profiling.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFIX_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON
cmake --build build --parallel
./build/fixed_numerical_bench 5000000 42
./build/fixed_numerical_bench 1000000000 42 normalize
```

For a fair before/after comparison, compile the **same benchmark source** against
both revisions, with the same compiler and flags. For example, on Clang/GCC:

```sh
git worktree add --detach ../fixed-baseline d0884f2a0e03b74ecf58a3a0e2d4717d48183230
cc -O3 -g -DNDEBUG -ffp-contract=off -I ../fixed-baseline/include \
  benchmark/numerical_bench.c ../fixed-baseline/src/fixed_math.c \
  ../fixed-baseline/src/fixed_vec.c -lm -o build/bench-before
cc -O3 -g -DNDEBUG -ffp-contract=off -I include \
  benchmark/numerical_bench.c src/fixed_math.c src/fixed_vec.c -lm -o build/bench-after
for trial in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  ./build/bench-before 5000000 42 > "build/before-$trial.csv"
  ./build/bench-after 5000000 42 > "build/after-$trial.csv"
done
```

Add `-DFIX_FORCE_EMULATED_INT128` to **both** compile commands to compare the
software integer backend. Output changes are expected for corrected operations;
checksums prevent unused work but do not replace the regression suite.

## Profiling and optimization passes

The repair was measured in successive optimized builds. On macOS, `sample` took
three-second profiles at 1 ms intervals while the normalize-only workload ran.
The baseline profile put nearly all samples in the normalization kernel; source
inspection identified its restoring square root and precision-lift loop. After
introducing an exactly repaired hardware
square-root seed for inputs up to 104 bits, the profile exposed an outlined
normalization helper. Forcing that helper inline and using the compiler's leading
zero intrinsic removed most of the remaining overhead. Larger square roots still
use the restoring algorithm. Both routes return the exact integer floor.

An initial repair also lifted ordinary quaternions unnecessarily. Keeping the
existing near-unit path retained its rounding and avoided that cost. A single
norm bound now proves that all shifted component numerators fit the hardware
divide, replacing repeated per-component checks. Inputs near both sides of the
fast-path boundaries are covered by regression tests.

AABB transformation retains full rotation coefficients until the final outward
rounding. This fixes containment and removes enough repeated fixed-point
multiplication to outperform the old calculation. Overflow-free half sums and
differences also make center/extents calculation cheaper.

## September 7, 2026 results

Apple M3 Ultra, arm64 macOS 26.6.2, Apple Clang 21.0.0
(`clang-2100.1.1.101`), using the flags above. Baseline is `d0884f2a`; after is
the numerical-correctness repair accompanying this benchmark. Each cell is the
median of five alternating before/after runs with seed 42: five million calls
per operation for native arithmetic, 500,000 for emulated arithmetic. Lower is
better. [All trial measurements and checksums](2026-09-07-m3-ultra.csv) are retained.

The substantial normalization and bounds improvements held across repeated passes.
Combined vector/quaternion normalization stayed close to the original timing.
The extra overflow checks cost about 0.18 ns in native validity and clamped
quantization here. Emulated angle extraction costs about 2.55 ns more for the pair
of calls. Those costs remain visible instead of being hidden in an aggregate
score; correctness requires retaining the full squared components and checking
the conversion range.

## Measurement limits

These are cache-resident microbenchmarks of 1,024 inputs on one machine, using
CPU time. Vectors span approximately +/-8 units; quaternion inputs contain four
ordinary rotations. The combined angle row calls both quaternion and swing angle
extraction. Short and full-range inputs are correctness-tested but are not the
ordinary-input timing distribution here. The software backend runs on the same
ARM CPU; it is not a Windows performance measurement.

Sub-nanosecond differences are sensitive to scheduling and code layout, so small
percentage changes should not be interpreted as precise application-level costs.
There is no claim of a whole-simulation speedup or zero regression on every
compiler, CPU, and input distribution. Measure a consuming application's workload
before choosing a frame-time budget from these numbers. CI compiles the benchmark
on all supported toolchains but does not enforce timing thresholds.
